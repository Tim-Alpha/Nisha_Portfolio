            <h3>Working on Computer</h3>
            <p>I ❤️ coding. When I was 21 I start learn coding because I want to develop my own website game that can be played on each and ever device even of a low ram device. Like painters, computer programmers take a blank space and fill it with something new and creative. For painters, that blank space is a canvas on an easel, which is then filled with paint; for programmers, it is an empty page on a computer screen, which is then filled with code. They both also develop an end idea of what they would like to create — whether that is an adventure game, a social networking site, or an expense tracker. They then set to work building their idea, with an endless number of ways to get there. If one idea doesn't work out, the programmer moves on to the next.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>I like to solve challenges, I like coffee and chocolates.</br>I ❤️ teaching, so  I decide 🧐 to teach a smarter student 😄😃🤪 that reflect my knowledge without any mistakes 😊. In future I want to work on machine learning and data structure.
            </br>Also like painting, computer programming is a form of self-expression that is accessible to virtually anyone. A background in math is not necessary for programming, nor are college courses — all that is required is a computer and an idea.</p>
